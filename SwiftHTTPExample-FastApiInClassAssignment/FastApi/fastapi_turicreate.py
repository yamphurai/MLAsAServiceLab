In this example, we will use FastAPI as a gateway into a MongoDB database. We will use a REST style 
interface that allows users to initiate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. These commands will 
also be used to control certain functionalities with machine learning, using the ReST server to
function as a machine learning as a service, MLaaS provider. 

Specifically, we are creating an app that can take in motion sampled data and labels for 
segments of the motion data

The swift code for interacting with the interface is also available through the SMU MSLC class 
repository. 
Look for the https://github.com/SMU-MSLC/SwiftHTTPExample with branches marked for FastAPI and
turi create

To run this example in localhost mode only use the command:
fastapi dev fastapi_turicreate.py

Otherwise, to run the app in deployment mode (allowing for external connections), use:
fastapi run fastapi_turicreate.py

External connections will use your public facing IP, which you can find from the inet. 
A useful command to find the right public facing ip is:
ifconfig |grep "inet "
which will return the ip for various network interfaces from your card. If you get something like this:
inet 10.9.181.129 netmask 0xffffc000 broadcast 10.9.191.255 
then your app needs to connect to the netmask (the first ip), 10.9.181.129
